            market conditions to provide you with reliable price estimates.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Important Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            While we strive for accuracy, our price estimates are based on available market data and should be 
            used as a reference point, not as definitive valuations. Actual car values can vary based on condition, 
            location, specific features, and negotiation. We recommend using our tool as one of several resources 
            when making purchasing decisions.
